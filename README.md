# **Facial Image Generation using GANs**

## Introduction

This project uses **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate **photorealistic human face images**. The model allows for **custom feature adjustments**, enabling users to control attributes such as **smiling, hair color, facial hair, and more**. A **Flask web app** is included for easy interaction.
